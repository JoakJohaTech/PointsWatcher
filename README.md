# PointsWatcher App

A React Native app aimed for Android 13. In this app you can calculate your points and log your remaining ponints.

The Points system is based on WW old points system.
More info can be found in the /docs folder.

This app uses [React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com) for its UI.
## Requirments

Node 18, Android 13, npm

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**

run the following command from the _root_ of the project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start the _Android_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android
```

### For iOS

I'm not putting any attention on iOS support. Expect stuff to be broken.

## Step 3: Done!

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
